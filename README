peakdetect is a small C program which is used to detect peaks in a wave data.
It is originally inspired by Eli Billauer's peakdet for MATLAB:

http://billauer.co.il/peakdet.html

To compile it, what you need is only a ANSI C compliant compiler, such as gcc
(GNU C Compiler), Microsoft Visual C++, Intel C Compiler, etc. Any of the
following commands will compile the source:

GNU C Compiler:         gcc -O2 -o peakdetect peakdetect.c
Microsoft Visual C++:   cl -O2 peakdetect.c
Intel C Compiler:       icc -O2 -o peakdetect peakdetect.c

Then use "/path/to/peakdetect --help" command to see the usage.
